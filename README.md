# SIDS-Moniter
Iot based SIDS Monitoring System
The aim of this project was to develop an IoT based system to control and monitor cradles for
babies. The user would be able to control parameters such as music player, swing control as well
as monitor things like motion detection, pulse oximeter, camera, humidity and temperature.
We have used Raspberry Pi and some sensors in the project and the system runs on Raspbian OS.
The project is integrated with the webpage, so that the user can use this project remotely through
a webpage.
The project will be ready to use in plug and play mode. We have tested each component and
their result before integrating it with the webpage. Finally, to support early users, we have
created a user guide, which will help them to understand and use our system.
